## Predicting this season's Premier League

I use a simplified version of [David Firth's approach](https://github.com/DavidFirth/alt3code) to predict the outcome of this season's Premier League. 

Here are those predictions:

```{r}
readr::read_csv(
  file = "projections.csv", 
  show_col_types = FALSE
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable(
    format = "html",
    col.names = c("Team ", "Played", "Expected Points"), 
    digits = c(0, 0, 1),
    padding = 5
    )
```
