## Predicting this year's Premier League

This repo uses a simplified version of [David Firth's methodology](https://github.com/DavidFirth/alt3code) to predict the outcome of the Premier League for this season. Here are those predictions:

```{r}
data <- readr::read_csv(file = "projections.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

data |> 
  dplyr::select(Team, Played, "Expected Points" = Exp_Points) |> 
  gt::gt()
```
